A Bullet Payment is a simple unidirectional one-off payment.
The reason for the payment is not captured.


## Key classes

A Bullet Payment is represented in Strata using the [`BulletPayment`]({{site.baseurl}}/apidocs/com/opengamma/strata/product/payment/BulletPayment.html) class.
The `BulletPayment` class stores details of the product that was agreed.
The trade details are stored in [`BulletPaymentTrade`]({{site.baseurl}}/apidocs/com/opengamma/strata/product/payment/BulletPaymentTrade.html) class.

A `BulletPayment` can be created using a builder as follows:

```java
BulletPayment bp = BulletPayment.builder()
  .payReceive(PayReceive.PAY)
  .value(CurrencyAmount.of(GBP, 20_000))
  .date(AdjustableDate.of(LocalDate.of(2014, 9, 16), BusinessDayAdjustement.of(FOLLOWING, GBLO)))
  .build();
```
