The curves loader is used to load pre-calibrated curves into the system.
It is one of a number of [loaders]({{site.baseurl}}/loaders) included in Strata.


## Loader

Curves can be loaded using the [`RatesCurvesCsvLoader`]({{site.baseurl}}/apidocs/com/opengamma/strata/loader/csv/RatesCurvesCsvLoader.html)

```
ResourceLocator groupsLocator = ResourceLocator.ofFile(groupsFilename);
ResourceLocator settingsLocator = ResourceLocator.ofFile(settingsFilename);
ResourceLocator curvesLocator = ResourceLocator.ofFile(curvesFilename);
List<CurveGroup> curves = RatesCurvesCsvLoader.load(
    valuationDate, groupsLocator, settingsLocator, ImmutableList.of(curvesLocator));
```

Curves must be loaded as part of a group, that specifies a purpose for the curve, such as whether it is
a discount or forward curve. See the [curve groups]({{site.baseurl}}/curve_groups_file) file for more details.

Settings that are shared across all the nodes in a curve are defined in the
[curve settings]({{site.baseurl}}/curve_settings_file) file.


## Format

The curves file is a simple CSV-formatted file with the following header row:

```
Valuation Date,Curve Name,Date,Value,Label
```

The columns may be specified in any order, however this is the recommended order.
The meaning of each column is as follows:

| Field          | Description                                                                          |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Valuation Date | The valuation date that the curve was calibrated for, in the format `yyyy-MM-dd`.    |
| Curve Name     | The name of the curve.                                                               |
| Date           | The date of the curve node, in the form `yyyy-MM-dd`.                                |
| Value          | The value associated with the curve node.                                            |
| Label          | A description of the node, used to identify it in bucketed sensitivity results.      |

A single curve will consist of at least two nodes, and typically many more, with one row required for each node.
Each curve must be contained within a single CSV file, but a single file may contain multiple curves.


## Example

This example file specifies one curve.

Note that Microsoft Excel prefers the CSV file to have no spaces after the comma.
