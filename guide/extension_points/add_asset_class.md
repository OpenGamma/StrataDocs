TODO

* Define a class for the asset class
  * Immutable Joda Bean - why?
  * Flat hierarchy - no implementation inheritance, only interface
* Write functions to calculate measures for the new asset class - link to "adding a new measure"
* Create pricing rules including the new asset class and functions - link to "pricing rules"
