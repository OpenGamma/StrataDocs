Strata provides information about the standard market conventions for various indices.
These represent the correct convention to our best knowledge at the time of coding.

Strata defines an index as "an agreed mechanism for determining certain financial indicators,
such as exchange rates or interest rates". Most common indices are published each working day.


## Overnight Indices:

An Overnight index is used to represent the rate where money is deposited for one night.
Usually this is from today to tomorrow, but it can be from tomorrow to the day after, known as "tom/next".
