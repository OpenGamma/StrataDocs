## Swap

A rate swap is a financial instrument that represents the exchange of streams of payments.
The swap is formed of legs, where each leg typically represents the obligations
of the seller or buyer of the swap. In the simplest vanilla interest rate swap,
there are two legs, one with a fixed rate and the other a floating rate.
Many other more complex swaps can also be represented.

For example, a swap might involve an agreement to exchange the difference between
the fixed rate of 1% and the GBP LIBOR rate every 3 months for 2 years.

The Strata swap instrument covers four types of legs - Fixed, Ibor rate, Overnight rate and Inflation rate.
Other types of swap have their own instruments.


## Key classes

A rate swap is represented in Strata using the [`Swap`]({{site.baseurl}}/apidocs/com/opengamma/strata/product/swap/Swap.html) class.
The `Swap` class stores details of the product that was agreed.
The trade details are stored in [`SwapTrade`]({{site.baseurl}}/apidocs/com/opengamma/strata/product/swap/SwapTrade.html) class.

A `Swap` can be created using a builder as follows:

```java
SwapLeg payLeg = RateCalculationSwapLeg.builder()
  .payReceive(PayReceive.PAY)
  .accrualSchedule(PeriodicSchedule.builder()
    .startDate(LocalDate.of(2014, 9, 12))
    .endDate(LocalDate.of(2021, 9, 12))
    .frequency(Frequency.P6M)
    .businessDayAdjustment(BusinessDayAdjustment.of(MODIFIED_FOLLOWING, HolidayCalendars.USNY))
    .build())
  .paymentSchedule(PaymentSchedule.builder()
    .paymentFrequency(Frequency.P6M)
    .paymentDateOffset(DaysAdjustment.NONE)
    .build())
  .notionalSchedule(NotionalSchedule.of(Currency.USD, 100_000_000))
  .calculation(FixedRateCalculation.of(0.015, DayCounts.THIRTY_U_360))
  .build();

SwapLeg receiveLeg = RateCalculationSwapLeg.builder()
  .payReceive(PayReceive.RECEIVE)
  .accrualSchedule(PeriodicSchedule.builder()
    .startDate(LocalDate.of(2014, 9, 12))
    .endDate(LocalDate.of(2021, 9, 12))
    .frequency(Frequency.P3M)
    .businessDayAdjustment(BusinessDayAdjustment.of(MODIFIED_FOLLOWING, HolidayCalendars.USNY))
    .build())
  .paymentSchedule(PaymentSchedule.builder()
    .paymentFrequency(Frequency.P3M)
    .paymentDateOffset(DaysAdjustment.NONE)
    .build())
  .notionalSchedule(NotionalSchedule.of(Currency.USD, 100_000_000))
  .calculation(IborRateCalculation.of(IborIndices.USD_LIBOR_3M))
  .build();

Swap swap = Swap.of(payLeg, receiveLeg);
```


## Pricing

The `strata-pricer` module provides pricing support for swaps:

* `DiscountingSwapProductPricer`, see [Javadoc]({{site.baseurl}}/apidocs/com/opengamma/strata/pricer/swap/DiscountingSwapProductPricer.html).
* `DiscountingSwapTradePricer`, see [Javadoc]({{site.baseurl}}/apidocs/com/opengamma/strata/pricer/swap/DiscountingSwapTradePricer.html).

The following pricing methods are available:

* present value, and associated sensitivity
* forecast value, and associated sensitivity
* par rate, and associated sensitivity
* par spread, and associated sensitivity
* accrued interest
* currency exposure
